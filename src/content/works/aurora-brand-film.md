A cinematic brand film for Aurora Cosmetics, blending natural beauty with urban sophistication. The project required capturing the delicate textures of skincare products while maintaining the energy of Tokyo's cityscape.

## Approach

We chose to shoot primarily with natural light, complementing it with minimal LED setups for product close-ups. The color grade leans warm with lifted shadows to create an inviting, premium feel.
