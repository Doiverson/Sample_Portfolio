A high-energy exploration of fashion and identity in Tokyo's electric town. We pushed the color grade into bold, almost surreal territory to match the cyberpunk aesthetic.

## Approach

We shot guerrilla-style across Akihabara over two nights, using the district's existing neon lighting as our primary light source. The edit is fast-paced with match cuts and rhythm-synced transitions.
