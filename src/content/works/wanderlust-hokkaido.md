Capturing the raw beauty of Hokkaido required patience, resilience, and a willingness to embrace unpredictable weather. We spent two weeks on location, often waking before dawn to catch the perfect light.

## Approach

We followed a hybrid documentary style — planned compositions for landscapes with organic, observational footage of local life. The sound design was given equal importance to the visuals.
