An exploration of urban solitude through the lens of Tokyo's nightlife. Every frame was designed to feel like a painting, with careful attention to practical lighting from neon signs and street lamps.

## Approach

We embraced available light wherever possible, using only small LED panels for fill. The entire video was shot handheld to create an intimate, documentary-like feel.

## Technical Details

- Camera: RED Komodo
- Lenses: Vintage Canon FD primes (24mm, 35mm, 50mm)
- Shot at ISO 3200 for natural grain texture
- Delivery: 4K UHD, HDR10
